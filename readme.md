# DSA in JavaScript: The 80/20 Guide

Welcome! This repository is a personal and growing collection of essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, all implemented in JavaScript.

## The Philosophy

The goal here isn't to solve every problem under the sun. Instead, this repository follows the **80/20 principle**: focusing on the critical 20% of DSA patterns and problems that provide 80% of the value for interviews and building a strong programming foundation.

This repository is also a documentation of my personal growth. I will be improving the solutions and adding new problems as I learn. My hope is that this living document can serve as a straightforward, no-fluff resource for anyone looking to get started or brush up on their DSA skills in JavaScript.

## How to Use This Repo

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-in-Javascript.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a problem:** The problems are organized by common coding patterns.
3.  **Try it yourself:** Before looking at the solution, try to code it up on your own.
4.  **Review and learn:** Compare your solution with the one provided. The code includes comments to explain the logic and approach.

## Repository Structure

The problems are organized by the pattern they represent. This helps in recognizing which tool to use when you encounter a new problem.

## Contributing

While this is a personal project, feedback and suggestions are always welcome! If you see a way to improve a solution or want to suggest a "must-know" problem, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Add missing problem files to any pattern folder in the repo format.
- Generate a template for new problems that matches the repository style.
- Link specific functions or symbols to their implementations (e.g. [`findPermutation`](Patterns/Sliding%20Window/Permutation%20in%20a%20String.js))
